Guest login only - no user choice anymore- need to get sudo rights
Press Ctrl + Alt +F1 log in(with your proper account),
Then,
Sudo -e /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf 

Edit the place to allow guest mode to be false,
Then, 
Ctrl +s (save)
Ctrl + x(to exit)
Then,
Sudo sytemctl restart lightdm

And atleast one lesson learnt. Welcome to linux  it is configurable to a fault..
